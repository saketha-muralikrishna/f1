            <h2>Smart Tech Powers F1 Cars</h2>
            <p>At the heart of **Formula 1** is amazing new technology. An **F1 car** is a complex machine. It shows off advanced aerodynamics, hybrid engines, and light materials. Every part is carefully made and tested. This ensures the best speed and reliability, even in tough conditions.</p>
            <h3>Aerodynamics: How Air Helps</h3>
            <p>How air moves around the car is key to F1 performance. Wings, diffusers, and complex body parts are made to push the car hard onto the track. This helps it take turns super fast. Teams are always improving how the car moves through the air all season.</p>
            <h3>Hybrid Engines: Strong & Smart Power</h3>
            <p>Today's F1 cars use 1.6-liter V6 turbocharged hybrid engines. These engines are complex. They mix a fuel engine with two electric units (MGUs). These MGUs save energy from braking and exhaust. Then, they use it for extra power. This mix of fuel and electric power shows how F1 aims for smart, new ideas. These ideas often find their way into regular cars too.</p>
